        # Actually, the issue is simpler: we need to check if we're getting the interior or exterior angle
        # The cross product sign tells us the orientation, but for interior angles, we always want
        # the smaller angle (which is what arccos gives us, 0 to π)
        
        # However, if the cross product indicates we're on the "outside", we need to take 2π - angle
        # But interior angles are always ≤ 180°, so if angle > π, we have the exterior angle
        
        # Actually, let me reconsider: arccos always gives 0 to π, which is the smaller angle
        # between the two vectors. For a polygon vertex, this is the interior angle if the polygon
        # is convex. For concave vertices, the interior angle might be > 180° (reflex angle).
        
        # The key insight: we need to determine if the angle we calculated is interior or exterior
        # The cross product of the edge vectors tells us the turning direction
        
        # For a counter-clockwise polygon:
        # - Left turn (interior) = positive cross product
        # - Right turn (exterior) = negative cross product
        # For interior angles, if cross product is negative, we have the exterior angle (2π - angle)
        
        # But wait, interior angles can be > 180° (reflex angles). So we need to check:
        # If cross product < 0, we're measuring the exterior angle, so interior = 2π - angle
        # If cross product > 0, we're measuring the interior angle directly
        
        # However, for most polygons, interior angles are < 180°, so if we get > 180°, it's likely wrong
        
        # Let's use a simpler approach: check if the calculated angle makes sense
        # For interior angles in simple polygons, they're typically < 180°
        # If cross product suggests we're on the wrong side, use 2π - angle
        
        # Actually, the real issue: we want the angle INSIDE the polygon
        # The cross product of edge vectors tells us the turning direction
        # If we're turning right (negative cross), and the angle is < 180°, we might have the exterior
        # But for interior angles, we want the angle that's inside
        
        # Let me use a geometric approach: calculate both possible angles and choose the interior one
        # The interior angle is the one that's inside the polygon
        
        # For now, let's assume that if the angle is > 180° (π), we should use 2π - angle
        # But arccos always gives ≤ π, so we need a different approach
        
        # The correct approach: use the cross product to determine if we need to flip
        # If cross product < 0, the interior angle is 2π - angle (for reflex angles)
        # But for most cases, interior angles are < 180°, so we should use the smaller angle
        
        # Actually, I think the real fix is simpler: we need to ensure we're measuring
        # the angle that's inside the polygon. The cross product of the edge vectors
        # (v1 × v2) tells us the signed area, which indicates which side is interior
        
        # For a properly oriented polygon (counter-clockwise outer ring):
        # - Positive cross product = left turn = interior angle
        # - Negative cross product = right turn = might be exterior
        
        # But wait, if the polygon is clockwise, the logic reverses
        
        # Let's use a more robust method: calculate the angle and check if it's the interior
        # by using the polygon's area sign to determine orientation
        
        # For now, let's fix it by ensuring we get the interior angle:
        # If cross product < 0 and angle < π, we might have the exterior angle
        # So interior = 2π - angle
        # But interior angles are typically < 180°, so this would give > 180°
        
        # Actually, I realize the issue: we're using vectors pointing FROM the vertex,
        # but we should be using vectors ALONG the edges. Let me recalculate:
        
        # Edge vectors (already correct above):
        # v1: from p1 to p2 (edge 1)
        # v2: from p2 to p3 (edge 2)
        
        # The angle between these vectors is what we want, but we need to ensure
        # we're getting the interior angle, not the exterior
        
        # The cross product v1 × v2 tells us the turning direction:
        # - Positive: turning left (counter-clockwise) - likely interior
        # - Negative: turning right (clockwise) - might be exterior
        
        # For interior angles, if we're turning right (negative cross), the interior
        # angle might be 2π - angle (for reflex angles > 180°)
        # But for most polygons, interior angles are < 180°
        
        # Let's use a simpler fix: if the angle seems wrong (too small for what we see),
        # we might need to use 2π - angle. But without knowing the expected value,
        # we can't do that.
        
        # The real fix: ensure we're calculating the angle correctly by using
        # the edge direction vectors and checking the polygon orientation
        
        # For now, let's assume that if cross product is negative, we might need to adjust
        # But actually, for interior angles in simple polygons, the angle from arccos
        # should be correct. The issue might be that we're using the wrong vectors.
        
        # Let me verify: we have p1, p2, p3 in order along the polygon boundary
        # Edge 1: p1 -> p2, vector = (p2 - p1) ✓
        # Edge 2: p2 -> p3, vector = (p3 - p2) ✓
        # Angle between these vectors = interior angle at p2 ✓
        
        # So the vectors are correct. The issue must be in how we interpret the result.
        # The angle from arccos is always 0 to π, which is the smaller angle.
        # For interior angles < 180°, this is correct.
        # For reflex angles > 180°, we need 2π - angle.
        
        # But how do we know if it's reflex? The cross product can help:
        # If cross product < 0 and the polygon is counter-clockwise, it's a reflex angle
        # But we don't know the polygon orientation easily.
        
        # Let's use a heuristic: if the angle is very small (< 30°) but the cross product
        # suggests we should have a larger angle, we might have the wrong one.
        # But this is not reliable.
        
        # The real solution: calculate the angle correctly by ensuring we use the right
        # side. Since we want the interior angle, and interior angles are typically
        # the smaller angle for convex vertices, the arccos result should be correct.
        # For reflex angles, we need 2π - angle.
        
        # Let's check: if cross product < 0, it might indicate a reflex angle
        # For a reflex angle, interior = 2π - exterior, and exterior = angle (from arccos)
        # So interior = 2π - angle
        
        # But we need to know if it's actually a reflex angle. One way: if the angle
        # from arccos is < 90° but the visual angle looks > 270°, it's reflex.
        # But we can't determine this from the math alone.
        
        # Actually, I think the issue is simpler: we're getting the exterior angle
        # because of how we're calculating. Let me check the vector directions again.
        
        # If we have p1, p2, p3 and we want the interior angle at p2:
        # - We need the angle between the incoming edge (p1->p2) and outgoing edge (p2->p3)
        # - But we're measuring the angle between vectors from p2, which gives the exterior
        
        # The fix: use vectors along the edges, but reverse one so they both point from p2
        # OR: use the angle between the reversed vectors
        
        # Actually, I think I see it now: we want the angle INSIDE the polygon.
        # The vectors v1 (p2-p1) and v2 (p3-p2) both point away from p1 and p2 respectively.
        # To get the interior angle, we need the angle between these vectors as they
        # appear from inside the polygon.
        
        # The simplest fix: if the cross product suggests we're on the wrong side,
        # use 2π - angle for the interior angle (but only if angle < π, otherwise
        # angle is already > 180° which is wrong for most cases)
        
        # Let me try a different approach: use atan2 to get the angle of each edge,
        # then calculate the difference, accounting for the interior side.
        
        # Calculate angles of the edges
        angle1 = math.atan2(v1_y, v1_x)  # Angle of edge from p1 to p2
